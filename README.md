# My simplest pong
I just realized that I've never made a Pong game, so I created one in a casual queue. Maybe my next project should be a runner?
If for some reason you need to edit or use the project folder, you'll need to uncompress the sprite.zip, I upload this project without set-up my git, and there's more than 100 files for the counter (maybe there's a smarter way to count :v).
